#  OUTPUT
# Provides:
#  APPS_OBJS: The application object files

# Defines build environment

# - include each binary in its own section
# This is a intermediate target that will be automagically deleted by make
# at the end of the build. It ensures that the script is entirely
# re-generated at each build.
